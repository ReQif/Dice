# Dice
The "Dice" program is a simple GUI application built using the Tkinter library in Python. The purpose of the program is to simulate a roll of a six-sided dice, and display the number rolled as well as the dots on the dice face.

When the "Roll Dice" button is clicked, the program generates a random number between 1 and 6, and then draws the corresponding dots on the dice face using the turtle module. The number rolled is also displayed in the "Dots" label.

The program includes a "Exit" button which can be clicked to close the application.

The GUI is designed using the ttkbootstrap library, which provides a set of Bootstrap-themed widgets that can be easily customized.

Overall, the "Dice" program is a fun and interactive way to simulate a roll of a dice, and can be a useful starting point for anyone interested in learning GUI programming with Python and Tkinter.
